## 1. Theory
### What is Ethereum
Ethereum is an open source software running on a decentralized network of computers. Ethereum maintains consensus across all the computers in it's network with Proof of Work (PoW). In the near future Ethereum will be moving to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism.

### Ethereum Basics
#### What is Ether
Ethereum has a native currency called "Ether", or "Eth".

#### What are Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are small computer programs that are replicated and processed on all the computers on the Ethereum network without a central coordinator. Smart Contracts allow you to program contracts that can be automatically enforced by computer code.  

#### What are ERC20 Tokens
In addition to Ether, people can also create and use their own currencies on Ethereum. The most common form of currency is ERC20 tokens. ERC20 Tokens are smart contracts that fit the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 standard was created so that everyone could follow it and create tokens that behave in the same way.

#### Your keys, your crypto
Never give out your private keys or seed phrase. If anyone ever asks for them, refuse!
